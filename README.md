# NHANES Breast Cancer Analysis (2017â€“2020)

ðŸŽ“ **Course Project** | SAS Studio on Demand | Public Health + Logistic Regression  
ðŸ“Š Exploring factors associated with breast cancer diagnosis in U.S. women using NHANES data.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project investigates demographic, behavioural, and clinical predictors of breast cancer diagnosis using the NHANES 2017â€“March 2020 pre-pandemic cycle. The entire analysis was performed in **SAS Studio on Demand**, with full consideration for NHANESâ€™ complex survey design (strata, clusters, and weights).

Key steps included:
- Importing and cleaning multiple NHANES datasets
- Creating derived variables and collapsing categories
- Conducting descriptive and bivariate analyses
- Running full and reduced logistic regression models
- Exploring interaction effects and survey-adjusted statistics

## âœ¨ Personal Note

> _This is my first humble attempt at executing a complete data analysis project in **SAS Studio on Demand**, including logistic regression and survey-based modelling. I know I have much to learn, so if you have suggestions, I welcome your constructive feedback. Thank you for reading!_

## ðŸ“Œ Status

âœ… Completed and submitted, got a nice grade too, but my hunger to keep learning to code on SAS Studio On Demand did not stop!
ðŸ“ˆ Future idea: Replicate this workflow using R (survey package) or Python (statsmodels + pandas).
